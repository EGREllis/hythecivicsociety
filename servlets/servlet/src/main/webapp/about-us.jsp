Our membership amounts to about 5% of the population (one of the highest listed by Civic Voice), demonstrating that civic pride is very much alive in Hythe.</p>

                  <p>Our constitution sets out (among other things) these objectives:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li/>
                    <p>to promote high standards of planning and architecture,</p>
                    <li/>
                    <p>to inform the public in the geography, history, natural history and architecture of the area,</p>
                    <li/>
                    <p>to secure the preservation, protection, development and improvement of features of historic or public interest,</p>
                    <li/>
                    <p>to promote civic pride,</p>
                    <li/>
                    <p>to hold meetings, lectures and exhibitions.</p>
                  </ul>
                  <p> The Society has an executive committee consisting of Chairman, Vice-Chairman,</p>
                  <p> Hon. Treasurer, Hon. Secretary and up to twelve executive members, most with a specific area of responsibility and many with more than one.  Committee members are elected at Annual General Meetings held in May.  The committee meets every month to review progress on current activities and to manage the affairs of the Society.  Committee members give formal reports on their respective areas of responsibility to members annually at the AGM.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The committee is very well supported by volunteers from members who, in  addition to paying the very necessary and much appreciated  subscription, give their time and effort to help with tasks that  require more hands such as the distribution of newsletters.  Regular  helpers number about 100.  In addition we can rely on a good turnout  of members when called upon for special projects.</p>
                <p><span > We  have a flourishing and active history group.&nbsp; The Hythe  History Group  has regular meetings to discuss their research and to arrange  activities and </span><span >excursions.  As members of HCS they also make a valuable contribution to HCS </span><span >Projects  and Events.&nbsp;  For  more details of the Hythe History Group visit their website  at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hythehistory.org/">http://www.hythehistory.org</a> .</span></p>

                <p> <img src="union 1.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="287" hspace="5" align="left">At the end of World War II, our town faced a major rebuilding  task. &nbsp;Some of the returning population had the foresight to see  that reconstruction would set the character of the town for the  future. They formed the HYTHE CITIZENS' UNION (HCU) in 1945 with the  task of monitoring every development and building project of  importance, and ensuring that public spaces, trees, and historical  landmarks were, as far as possible, restored to a high standard.
                </p>
                </span>
                <p> In  addition to housing and town planning, the founders of the Citizens&rsquo;  Union organised lectures, exhibitions and local history study, as  well as social events to increase membership, and raise funds. </p>
                <p ></p>
                <p> <img src="union 2.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="287" hspace="5" align="right">From  modest beginnings, membership steadily increased until 1957 when for  various reasons HCU activities were much reduced and membership  declined.  However, at about the same time amenity societies were  springing up all over the country, coinciding with the establishment  of the Civic Trust (now Civic  Voice).  Stalwarts of the HCU (now registered with the Civic Trust) organised  a programme of lectures and films and interest increased.  It was at  this time that they started the Local  History Group.   From fewer than twenty in 1960, membership rose to some sixty in  1964, one hundred was reached in 1967 and in 1976 membership was over  five hundred.  Now (2019) it is about 750.</p>
                <p > </p>
                <p> In  1965, the HCU decided to change its name to Hythe Civic Society to  bring it more into line with other amenity societies.  HCS became  more involved in planning matters and their influence became  increasingly effective.  Following the Local Government Act of 1972,  HCS suggested that the proposed new District be named &quot;the Lathe  of Shepway&quot; and this suggestion was brought to the notice of the  Boundary Commission.  &quot;Shepway&quot; was the name adopted in the  Local Government Act of 1974.  It is interesting to note that,  starting in 1960, the Society had elected the Mayor of the Borough of  Hythe to be their President during his term of office.  However, with  the passing of the Local Government Act of 1974, it was thought  better for the Society to have an independent President and the  practice ceased.  The last Mayor of the Borough and HCS President,  Cllr. Chris Capon, presented the Society with the Borough Trophy, a  handsome shield which later was re-named the Civic Society Award (see  Awards).   Since then the committee has invited and considered nominations for  awards annually. </p>

                <p> Our  Talks  have been well attended since their early beginning; so much so that,  in 2008 we changed our venue from the United Reformed Church to the  well-equipped hall at Hythe Bay School to accommodate audiences  sometimes exceeding 100.  Guided  Town Walks have  gone from strength to strength since they were started in 1974 and  their fame has spread: in addition to the weekly walks in summer, we  are often asked to host groups both local and from further afield.   Demand for  Summer  Outings  has  been more variable, being very popular in the mid-1900s but much less  so in recent years.</p>

                <p> Our  first Newsletter  appeared  in 1968, a monthly, closely-typed page of foolscap involving much  effort, now seeming comical, using museum-piece printing machines to  produce.  As late as the mid-1900s, the editor wrote the newsletter,  now four pages long, by hand and delivered it to a pal to type.  If  the typed version was too short the editor wrote more words: if too  long, they would chop some.  With the advent of word processors,  double columns were introduced in the December 1996 issue and in the  following March the town clock appeared as masthead for the first  time.  That issue also carried the first pictures - in black and  white: colour came later.  These days production is achieved entirely  electronically.  Our first website was launched in 2005 and we can  now contact our members with urgent news as soon as it is known.</p>
